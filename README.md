# vowelPlotsTemp

This repo contains a dataset of formant values of English monophthongs for 3 speakers of Southern Standard British English. The Jupyter notebook (still work in progress) shows how to produce F1-F2 plots in R, how to compute distances between pairs of vowels, plot these distances, etc. You can see what it looks like by clicking the button below (you don't need to install anything on your machine):
